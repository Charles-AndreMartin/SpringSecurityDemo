Spring Security & Vaadin Demo Application
=========================================

What is this application?

	The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how Spring Security can be used
	to secure web applications with Vaadin-based user interfaces. It also demonstrates
	how said applications can be localized using the localization features of Spring.
	
	Originally, the application was written for an article published on the Vaadin Wiki:
	http://vaadin.com/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Vaadin%20and%20Spring%20Security
	
Getting the source code

	The source code of this application is hosted on GitHub. If you do not have Git, you can
	download it from http://git-scm.com. When you are done, you can checkout the source by
	issuing the command:
	
	$ git clone http://github.com/peholmst/SpringSecurityDemo.git
	
Trying out the demo application

	Make sure you have JDK 6 and Maven 2.2. If not, you can download them from http://java.sun.com
	and http://maven.apache.org, respectively.
	
	Fire up the embedded Jetty server by issuing the command:
	
	$ mvn jetty:run
	
	Then, point your favorite browser to http://localhost:8080/springsecuritydemo and start
	exploring the application.
	
Editing the source code in Eclipse

	There are two (mutually exclusive) ways of importing the source code into Eclipse:
	
	1. Use the M2Eclipse plugin (http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org) and import the project
	   as a Maven project.
	   
	2. Ask Maven to generate the Eclipse project files for you by issuing the command:
	   
	   $ mvn eclipse:eclipse
		
	   Then import the project into your workspace. You will probably received some warnings about
	   classpath entries that will not be exported or published. You can ignore them, or manually
	   edit the project properties to remove them completely.
	   
Editing the source code in NetBeans

	NetBeans has built-in support for Maven, so all you have to do is open the project as
	any other project.
