Spring Security & Vaadin Demo Application
=========================================

Quick Start: Trying out the demo application

	Make sure you have JDK 6 and Maven 2.2. If not, you can download them from http://java.sun.com
	and http://maven.apache.org, respectively.
	
	Fire up the embedded Jetty server by issuing the command:
	
	$ mvn jetty:run
	
	Then, point your favorite browser to http://localhost:8080/springsecuritydemo and start
	exploring the application.
	
Quick Start: Editing the source code in Eclipse

	There are two (mutually exclusive) ways of importing the source code into Eclipse:
	
	1. Use the M2Eclipse plugin (http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org) and import the project
	   as a Maven project.
	   
	2. Ask Maven to generate the Eclipse project files for you by issuing the command:
	   
	   $ mvn eclipse:eclipse
		
	   Then import the project into your workspace.
	   
Quick Start: Editing the source code in NetBeans

	NetBeans has built-in support for Maven, so all you have to do is open the project as
	any other project.
